# 🏀 NBA Game Outcome Prediction Project

### 📅 Programming For Data Science - June 2024

Dear Reader,

If you are a sports enthusiast, you might have been tempted to bet on your favorite team. Sports betting has become very common and widespread. In 2023, this industry generated 85.41 billion dollars and is expected to reach more than 150 billion dollars by the year 2030.

As the ambitious students of a business school, we asked ourselves how we could predict the outcomes of an NBA game algorithmically. To achieve this, we downloaded five CSV files from the official NBA website (four are on GitHub, and one can be accessed through [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qzMIielw-0bP3HvDqpYAZ7qeQG2dQvxn/view?usp=sharing)).

### 📁 Project Structure

- **EDA.ipynb**: Contains our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **poisson.ipynb**: Implements a Poisson distribution-based model.
- **forest_lr.ipynb**: Implements a Random Forest machine learning model and a Logistic Regression model.
- **elo_model.ipynb**: Implements an ELO-based model.

### 🛠️ Running the Notebooks

To explore the different approaches, open the Jupyter notebooks in a Python environment. You can run each notebook to see our methodology and results for predicting NBA game outcomes.

### 📂 Data Files

- Four CSV files are available on GitHub.
- The fifth CSV file is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qzMIielw-0bP3HvDqpYAZ7qeQG2dQvxn/view?usp=sharing).

### 📊 Methodologies

1. **Poisson Distribution-Based Model**: See `poisson.ipynb`
2. **Random Forest & Logistic Regression Models**: See `forest_lr.ipynb`
3. **ELO-Based Model**: See `elo_model.ipynb`
